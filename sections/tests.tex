\section{Testing possible Optimization}
\textbf{Author: Timon Koch}

In order to find the best possible combination of serialisation and compression methods for use in RECT, different pairs are applied to the text of the King James Bible\footcite{king_james_bible}. The dataset consists of approximately 783,137 words spread over 66 books. The experiment aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the different pairs of compression and serialisation methods. First, the text is encoded using one of the serialisation methods. After serialisation, the data is compressed using one of the compression methods

The setup will maintain a standardised computing environment for consistency and the experiment will be repeated several times for each pair of serialisation and compression methods.

Performance metrics will include serialisation and deserialisation, compression and decompression time, and post-compression size. Statistical analysis will compare the performance of different methods.

\subsection{Compression}
By reducing the size of data, compression saves storage space, speeds up data transmission over networks and minimises bandwidth requirements, resulting in cost savings and improved operational efficiency. In addition, compressed data is easier to manage, share and access across platforms and devices. 

\subsubsection{Deflate}
The Deflate algorithm\footcite{deflate} is a widely used method of lossless data compression. It achieves compression by eliminating redundancy in the input data through a combination of LZ77\footcite{lz77} and Huffman coding\footcite{huffman_coding} techniques, making it an efficient and versatile compression method used in various applications.

In the first step, LZ77 identifies repeated substrings in the data and replaces them with references to previous occurrences, thereby reducing redundancy. This is followed by Huffman coding, which assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer codes to less frequent symbols, further compressing the data

\subsubsection{ZSTD}
ZSTD\footcite{zstd}, short for Zstandard, is a high performance data compression algorithm developed by Facebook. It is designed to provide both fast compression and decompression speeds while achieving excellent compression ratios, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

ZSTD uses a combination of advanced compression techniques, including a dictionary-based approach, context modelling and entropy coding. It dynamically builds and updates dictionaries during compression to improve compression efficiency by identifying and exploiting patterns in the data.

\subsubsection{GZIP}
GZIP\footcite{gzip}, short for GNU Zip, is based on the Deflate algorithm. While it's optimised for speed, GZIP also provides reasonably good compression ratios, making it a popular choice for applications where both speed and compression efficiency are important.

GZIP typically offers several levels of compression, allowing users to trade off compression ratio and speed according to their needs. Lower compression levels prioritise faster processing times, while higher levels prioritise better compression ratios at the expense of speed.


\subsection{Serialization Formats}
\textbf{Author: Timon Koch}

\subsubsection{JSON}
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\footcite{json} is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language\footcite{javascript}.

JSON consists of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, booleans, or null. It is highly versatile and widely supported across various programming languages and platforms.

Using JSON as the seriation method results in the following:

\end{table}

\subsubsection{YAML}
YAML\footcite{yaml} (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a data serialisation format commonly used for configuration files, data exchange, and specifying data structures in a clear, concise, and readable manner. It uses indentation and whitespace to represent data hierarchies, making it visually intuitive and easy to understand.

YAML supports multiple data types, including scalars (strings, numbers, booleans), sequences (arrays or lists), and mappings (key-value pairs). It also allows for comments, making it useful for annotating configurations and documentation.

Using YAML as the seriation method results in the following:

\subsubsection{Protobuf}
Protocol Buffers (protobuf)\footcite{protobuf} is a method of serialising structured data developed by Google. Designed to be efficient, portable and easy to use, it provides a platform-neutral way to encode data for communication between systems or for persistent storage.

Protobuf defines a schema for data structures using a language-agnostic interface description language (IDL)\footcite{idl}. This schema describes the structure of the data in a concise and platform-independent manner. From this schema, Protobuf compilers generate code in various programming languages, allowing developers to easily work with the defined data structures.

Using Protobuf as the seriation method results in the following:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Bincode}
Bincode\footcite{bincode} is a binary serialisation format designed for use with the Rust programming language. It allows the serialisation of Rust data structures into a compact binary representation that can be efficiently stored or transmitted. Bincode is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for scenarios where performance is critical, such as networking, file I/O or inter-process communication.

Using Bincode as the seriation method results in the following:

\subsubsection{Rust UTF-8}
Rust UTF-8\footcite{rust_utf8} is a variable-width encoding that can represent any Unicode code point using one to four bytes.

In Rust, strings are encoded as UTF-8\footcite{utf8} by default. This means that Rust provides native support for manipulating, validating, and converting UTF-8 encoded strings efficiently and securely. Rust's type system ensures that operations on strings are performed in a way that preserves the integrity of the UTF-8 encoding, preventing common problems such as invalid byte sequences or buffer overflows.

Using Rust UTF-8 as the seriation method results in the following:

\subsection{Chosing the optimal Database}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

RECT uses a register to store data about available connections and useable ports of other controllers. This register is stored in a in-memory database. In order to find the 
best database solution for our use case, we compare SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL. Using docker as testing environment we can easily compare the different databases.\newline

In order to test the databases without any influences from outside, we used docker container for each database and their corresponding client program. The client program
is written in rust and uses the corresponding rust librarys for the individual databases. However since SQLite is a file based database, we just used a volume to store the
database file, together with the rust program in one container. The rust program connects to the database and executes the queries. The program measures the time it 
takes to execute the query and prints it to the console. Because we are using docker, we can easily track the resource usage of the database container during the query.\newline

The test setup is as follows: We use four tables with 100 rows and 5 columns. The columns are of type integer and string and the rows are filled with random data. We then 
execute a simple select query with join statements to get all the data from the table. We measure the time it takes to execute the query and the resource usage of the database 
container. We repeat this process 50 times and calculate the average time it takes to execute the query.\newline

The results are as follows:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | m{3cm} | m{4cm}| m{4cm} | m{4cm} | } 
      \hline
      Database & avg time to execute & avg CPU usage & avg Memory usage \\ 
      \hline
      SQLite & 95,86ms & 15,67\% & 54,97MB \\ 
      \hline
      PostgreSQL & 105,52ms & 17,32\% & 58,86MB \\ 
      \hline
      MySQL & 109,63ms & 18,51\% & 59,12MB \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The results show that SQLite is the fastest database, and also uses the least amount of resources. Additionally, SQLite was the easiest to set up and use. So we decided to use
SQLite as the database for the register in RECT.
