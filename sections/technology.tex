\section{C++}
\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}

C++ is a high-level precompiled programming language with support for low level memory manegment, object oriented programming, generic and functional programming.
It was designed and created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup with efficiency, performance and flexibility as its core goals.\footcite{lecture_essence_cpp}
Being based on C, and due to its highly sophisticated design C++ is being used in all kinds of places nowadays. From desktop applications, servers, video games and 
even very performance critical use cases like digital equipment in space. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standardized this proagramming
language in 1998 as SO/IEC 14882:1998. Due to its populatrity many libraries and frameworks for C++ have been made including Catch2\footcite{catch2_git} and 
Doxygen\footcite{doxygen_main_site}.

\section{Rust}
\textbf{Author: Jeremy Sztavinovszki}

Rust is a general purpose multi paradigm programming language used in many fields ranging from embedded programming to web development. Although it is a relatively young language, having released its version 1.0 on May 15th 2015, it has seen great adoption from developers and has a big community. The language tries to be as fast as possibly, while still remaining memory-safe, which it achieves using its borrow checker. Even though it is possible to write unsafe code in Rust, that is not checked by the borrow checker, it is custom to keep the unsafe parts as small as possible.
Rust has a great ecosystem driven by the Rust Foundation and the Rust community. There are many tools, such as cargo, or rust-gdb, that provide great developer experience.
Right now there is now standardized async-runtime, so you normally use runtimes like tokio, async-std, or smol for programming asynchronously.

\section{Bluetooth Low Energy}
\textbf{Author: Jeremy Sztavinovszki}

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a low powered, low cost, low bandwidth radio communication technology, that was originally developed at Nokia in a project named Wibree. It was later noticed by the Bluetooth Special interest group and became part of the Bluetooth 4.0 Core Specification. Nowadays it is often used in all things ranging from wireless headphones to IOT devices and has seen great adoption in many different areas. The BLE protocol Stack, like others (e.g. TCP/IP) is separated into different layers. The layers are split into 3 overarching layers. There is the Application, Host and Controller layers.

\subsection{Application-Layer}
The Application-Layer is the highest layer in the stack and is responsible for containing logic, user interface and handling the data of the actual application using BLE.

\subsection{Host-Layer}
The Host-Layer itself splits off into several layers.

\subsection{Controller}
The controller is the layer works closely with the hardware. It contains the following layers

\subsection{Rusqlite}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Rusqlite is an ergonomic wrapper for using SQLite from Rust similar to rust-postgres. It provides an easy-to-use interface to work with SQLite databases. Using the functions provided by rusqlite you can perform all the common database operations, such as creating tables, inserting Data, querying data, and more simply within your code. 

We choose this library for SQLite mainly because of three reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Portability:} SQLite databases can be used across different platforms and operating systems. Given the fact that RECT operates on different small Controllers, portability is very important.
    \item \textbf{Configuration:} There is no need for any complex setup or configuration when working with SQLite. We only need a few tables to work with, so having to configure a database on each controller wouldn't be worth the effort.
    \item \textbf{Local:} SQLite doesn't need any separate server or installation. It contains all the features we need in a small an independent package.
\end{enumerate}

In our case we use rusqlite in order to save the config.json file, containing date for the available connections. Accessing the Data from the database is simply much quicker and saver than reading from the file when we need it. 

\subsection{Serde}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Serde is a framework for rust, used for \textbf{ser}ializing and \textbf{de}serializing data structures efficiently and generically. You can find a detailed serde overview \href{https://serde.rs/}{here}.

Serde provides functions to deserialize JSON-files in a simple and quick way, this allows us to use the data from the config.json file in our program with just a few lines of code.

With serde we deserialize the data from the JSON-file into a self-made rust structure, which allows us to use the data properly.  

\subsection{Tokio}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Tokio is asynchronous runtime for rust. In rust asynchronous code doesn't run on it's own in order to make it work the programmer has to use a runtime like Tokio. You can find more in depth descripton of Tokio \href{https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial}{here}. 

We picked Tokio because it is the most widely used runtime for async rust code. There are also a lot of Tutorials for Tokio and it is fairly simple to use.

Tokio as our asynchronous runtime allows us to execute multi-threaded async code safely.  

\subsection{Tonic}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Tonic is a rust framework that implements gRPC.
