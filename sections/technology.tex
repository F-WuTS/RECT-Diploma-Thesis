\section{C++}
\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}

C++ is a precompiled programming language that combines low-level memory management with support for object-oriented, generic, and functional programming paradigms. 
It was designed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup with a focus on efficiency, performance, and flexibility.\footcite{lecture_essence_cpp} C++ has 
become widely used in various domains, including desktop applications, servers, video games, and digital equipment for space exploration.\\

It was standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and has since evolved into a powerful programming 
language. The popularity of C++ has led to the creation of numerous libraries and frameworks, such as Catch2\footcite{catch2_git} and Doxygen\footcite{doxygen_main_site}. 
These frameworks are essential to the project's development and functionality.\\

C++ was chosen as one of the two frontend languages for this project due to its impressive speed and efficiency, as well as the vast ecosystem of external 
frameworks and libraries already available. The resources are essential in developing the RECT library, improving the project's capabilities and accelerating 
the development process. The decision to use C++ was a strategic choice, aligning with the language's strengths and the abundance of tools and resources it 
offers to the development landscape.

\section{Rust}
\textbf{Author: Jeremy Sztavinovszki}

Rust is a general purpose multi paradigm programming language used in many fields ranging from embedded programming to web development. Although it is a relatively young language, having released its version 1.0 on May 15th 2015, it has seen great adoption from developers and has a big community. The language tries to be as fast as possibly, while still remaining memory-safe, which it achieves using its borrow checker. Even though it is possible to write unsafe code in Rust, that is not checked by the borrow checker, it is custom to keep the unsafe parts as small as possible.
Rust has a great ecosystem driven by the Rust Foundation and the Rust community. There are many tools, such as cargo, or rust-gdb, that provide great developer experience.
Right now there is now standardized async-runtime, so you normally use runtimes like tokio, async-std, or smol for programming asynchronously.

\section{gRPC}
\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}

gRPC\footcite{grpc_main_site} is an open-source framework that facilitates Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) across diverse environments. It is versatile 
and can be used in a broad spectrum of use cases, proving invaluable in establishing robust service-to-service connections. gRPC plays a pivotal role in the 
development of microservices and libraries. This framework is available in 11 different programming languages and provides developers with a flexible 
and accessible toolset for creating efficient and scalable communication channels.\\

gRPC's efficiency is central to its straightforward service definition and generation structure, which streamlines the integration process. 
This simplicity allows developers to focus on the core aspects of their projects, enhancing productivity and code maintainability. Furthermore, gRPC includes 
pluggable features such as authentication, load balancing, tracing, and health checking. These features provide developers with fine-grained control over 
service communication, ensuring robust and secure interactions within distributed systems.\\

In the context of the current project, gRPC plays a pivotal role. Its capability to seamlessly connect clients to backend services is particularly crucial. 
This feature enables efficient communication between Python and C++ frontends and the Rust backend, creating a cohesive and interoperable system. The project 
uses gRPC to achieve high communication efficiency, allowing for seamless data exchange between components and improving the overall performance and reliability 
of the system architecture.

\section{Protocol Buffers}
\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}

Protocol Buffers offer a platform-neutral solution for serializing structured data, similar to formats such as XML, JSON, or YAML. They provide a versatile 
solution that seamlessly interfaces with automatically generated source code across an array of programming languages, catering to developers' preferences. 
Noteworthy among the supported languages are Java, Kotlin, Python, and various C-based languages, underscoring the broad applicability of Protocol Buffers 
in diverse development ecosystems.\\

Protocol Buffers enable developers to efficiently manage and exchange structured data across different platforms and systems. They provide a unified approach 
to serialization, whether using the robustness of Java, the conciseness of Kotlin, the flexibility of Python, or the performance advantages of C-based languages. 
This approach promotes interoperability, enabling developers to easily incorporate serialized data into their projects, thereby enhancing the efficiency and 
maintainability of their codebases.\\

An example of a Protocol Buffer file illustrates the elegance and conciseness inherent in this technology, demonstrating its role in facilitating efficient 
data interchange.

\begin{verbatim}
    syntax = "proto3";
    package msg;
    
    
    message From {
      string conn_name = 1;
      string topic = 2;
    }
    
    
    message To {
      string conn_name = 1;
      string topic = 2;
    }
    
    
    message Msg {
      bytes data = 1;
      oneof fromto {
        From f = 2;
        To t = 3;
      }
    }
\end{verbatim}

As can be seen in this example the first part of any .proto file is the definition of the protobuf language version. Either \textit{proto2} or \textit{proto3}. Next the package within this will be 
stored in when it is converted into a programming languages code is defined. In this case it will be \textit{msg}. After that you can import any other .proto file.
Then it is possible to define any amount of the following types and many others not used by this project:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{message:} Defines a special data structure that houses multiple variables of potentialy different data types, which can then be used in other enums or services.
    \item \textbf{enum:} Defines an enum which acts like the equivalent type of structure in other programming languages. This can then be used in other parts of then .proto file.
    \item \textbf{service:} Defines a Remot Procedure Call (RPC) system. The generated code for this will include service interfaces and stubs to be used by RPC frameworks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Protofile message definition}

Message types in proto3 are relatively simple to define.

\begin{verbatim}
    message message_name {
        field_type field_name = number;
      }
\end{verbatim}

First the \textit{message} keyword is used to signify that the following is a declaration for a message type. Then a freely choose able \textit{message\_name} is 
used as the name for the later resulting message structure. After that any number of fields can be defined within the curly brackets. The \textit{field\_type} can be
one of multiple supported data types, which includes but is not limited to double, flout, integer, boolean, string as well as bytes. After defining an appropriate
\textit{field\_name} this format requires the assignment of a number between 1 and 536,870,911 to each field in a message. This is required in order to identify
the field after encoding.

There are also three other modifiers, that can be applied to fields:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{optional:} If a field with this modifier does not have its value explicitly set later it will instead return a default value. It also possible to check if this it has been set.
    \item \textbf{repeated:} A field with this modifier can be repeated any number of times within the message and the order of the repetition will be saved.
    \item \textbf{map:} A field with this modifier acts like a key/value pair with the definition syntax being like that of a C++ map.
\end{enumerate}

Another way of defining fields, that can have a multitude or a currently unkown type, is to use either the \textit{any} or the \textit{oneof} types.
The \textit{any} type is then later resolved by Protobufs internal reflection code.
\textit{Oneof} is then automatically later defined as one of the given data types within curly brackets placed after the \textit{field\_name} is given.

\subsection{Protofile enum definition}

Enums are share a lot of the same traits as message types in terms of the defintion syntax.

\begin{verbatim}
    enum enum_name {
        constant_value = number;
    }
\end{verbatim}

Similarly to messages the enum is given an \textit{enum\_name} and then any number of \textit{constant\_value}s can be defined. All of these constants need an associated
value in order to function properly and the first of those needs to have 0 as its number, so that the enum has a default value in cases like fields with the \textit{optional}
modifier. 
In order to bind multiple \textit{constant\_value}s to the same \textit{number} the \textit{allow\_alias} option must be set to true. This is done by inserting this line
into the enum before any definition of \textit{constant\_value}s:

\begin{verbatim}
    option allow_alias = true;
\end{verbatim}

Once an enum is defined then it can be used in other parts of the Protocol Buffer, as seen in this example:

\begin{verbatim}
    enum Success {
        Ok = 0;
    }

    enum SendError {
        NoSuchConnection = 0;
        SendFailed = 1;
    }

    message SendResponse {
        oneof result {
            Success s = 1;
            SendError err = 2;
        }
    }
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Protofile service definition}

Services allow the easy generation of service interfaces and stubs to then be used by RPC implementations.

\begin{verbatim}
    service service_name{
        rpc rpc_name(message_type) returns (message_type) {}
        rpc rpc_name(message_type) returns (stream message_type) {}
    }
\end{verbatim}

A service is defined with a \textit{service\_name} and after that any number of inidvidual methods. In order to define the methods first the keyword \textit{rpc} must be used.
Then a name for the method is given through \textit{rpc\_name} and a parameter for the \textit{message\_type} that this method accepts. And then a \textit{message\_type}
is defined as the return value of the RPC. A stream of a particluar \textit{message\_type} can be defined by putting the keyword \textit{stream} before the type.

An example of this would be the SubListen service from this project:

\begin{verbatim}
    service SubListen{
        rpc listen(ListenRequest) returns (ListenResult) {}
        rpc subscribe(ListenRequest) returns (stream ListenResult) {}
    }
\end{verbatim}

\section{Nix}
\textbf{Author: Jeremy Sztavinovszki}

Nix is one of a couple of things depending on the context. It is either a configuration language, a package manager, an operating system, or a build system.
That may seem a bit confusing, but the next section will cover each of these contexts for the sake of clearing up some of the confusion, that may arise from this statement.

\subsection{History}
Nix was first conceived and made a reality in 2003 as a research project by Eelco Dolstra. At first it was just a package manager, that could be run on any distro, but in 2007 it became its
own full blown Linux distribution with many other additions to the Nix eco system, such as Hydra \footcite{hydra}, a continuous intergration tool, and nixops,
a deployment tool for nixos deploying NixOS in a network/cloud \footcite{NixOps}. At the time of writing Nix has gotten another big addition in the form of flakes.
Flakes are a way of declaratively building anything ranging from Nix packages, over development environments, to system configurations. When a flake is build for the first time it
pulls in all of its inputs and writes their commit hashes to a flake.lock file. Through this mechanism of noting the exact commit each input of a flake it is possible to use nix flakes for
reproducible builds.

\subsection{The Language}
The language was the first part of Nix, that was implemented and it is arguably the most important part of Nix. Nix is a declarative functional programming language,
that is used for defining packages, build processes and configurations for a host of things ranging from reproducible development environments to IT-Infrastructure.
Taking an example for the syntax from the official nixos wiki site the language looks something like this:

% example here
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Nix, caption={Simple Examples of the Nix Language}]
#1
let
    a = 1;
    b = 2;
in a+b
# result 3

#2
let
    square = x: x*x;
    a = 12;
in square a
#result 144

#3
let 
    add = x: y: x+y;
in add 1 2

#result 3

#4
let
    square = {x ? 2}: x*x;
    a = 12;
in square{x=square {};}

#result 16
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

%description of the example here

In examining the provided code, a discernible pattern emerges. The syntax \newline \verb+let <variables> in <statement>+ serves as a method for defining values within a forthcoming block and it is quite reminicent of the Haskell programming language. However, this construct encompasses more than mere value assignment.
Consideration of each distinct block sheds light on its functionality. Block No. 1 initializes two variables, 'a' and 'b', then performs an addition operation on them. It's noteworthy that if an additional variable 'c' were defined but left unused, it would remain unevaluated due to Nix's lazy evaluation mechanism.
Moving to Block No. 2, it defines a function named 'square'. This function accepts a parameter 'x', as indicated by the notation \verb+x: x*x+. Parameter declarations in this context follow the structure \verb+<parameter name>: <statement>+. However, when multiple variables are required, as demonstrated in Block No. 3, the syntax adapts to \verb+<parameter name 1>:<parameter name 2>: <statement>+. This paradigm bears resemblance to lambda calculus \footcite{lambda_calculus}.
Block No. 4 showcases optional parameters. This feature is denoted by \newline \verb+{<parameter name> ? <default value>}: <statement>+.


\subsection{The Package Manager}
Nix, now a package manager, is a cross-platform package manager, that claims to have solved a problem called dependency hell \footcite{dependency_hell}, by keeping track of which package needs which dependencies. If a package is no longer needed it can automatically be garbage collected. Packages are installed to a directory called the nix store and have a unique hash, which is generated by combining some factors, like dependencies, versions and so on.
When defining a package you use the nix programming language and lazy functional programming to declare how to build it, what you need to build it and what files to install through a format called derivations.

\subsection{The Build System}
The following example showcases how to use the Nix language to define a flake containing a package, which can be built and installed on any system running the Nix package manager.
The specific example builds the latex files of which this thesis is comprised into a pdf file using a build tool called latexmk.
\medskip

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Nix, caption={The nix flake, that builds this diploma thesis}]
{
  description = "A flake to build the RECT-Diploma-Thesis";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url ="github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.05";
  };

  outputs = {self, nixpkgs}:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in {
		packages.${system}.default = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
			name = "RECT-Diploma-Thesis";

			src = ./.;

			buildInputs = [
				pkgs.texlive.combined.scheme-full
			];

			buildPhase = ''
					latexmk -pdf main.tex
			'';

			installPhase = '' 
					mkdir -p $out/pdf
					cp main.pdf $out/pdf
			'';
		};
  };
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The code shown above is a nix flake. It defines the nixpkgs repository as an input and the result of the build process,
that is taking place in the mkDerivation block as an output. mkDerivation is a function which takes a name, pname, version, src,
buildInputs, buildPhase, installPhase, builder and shellHook as inputs and produces a package which is built in the standard environment (stdenv) \footcite{nixMkDerivation}.
The built derivation (or output of this flake) is then asigned a hash and stored in the nix store on the machine that built it.
An example of this would be the following path \newline\verb+/nix/store/dnx26izplgv46dwg548whh9kj5iz4vvx-RECT-Diploma-Thesis+. 

\subsubsection{Nixpkgs}
Of course the defined packages need to be stored somewhere. This is where the nixpkgs repository \footcite{nixpkgs_repo} on github comes in handy. It is a collection of over 80000 packages according to repology \footcite{repology_nixpkgs}.
The community can contribute their own definitions, or updates to the repository if they found something to be out of date, or missing. Of course when installing a package it is not built from scratch every time, like on source based distros.
Instead nixpkgs caches builds of the most popular packages, which then just have to be downloaded onto the users machines.

\subsection{The Operating System}
NixOS is built upon the Nix package manager. It is an independent Linux distribution, which means it is not based on any other Linux distribution like for example Debian, or Arch Linux.
What is really special about NixOS is, that the whole operating system with services, programs and all of the needed configurations can be built from one central file, which is written in the Nix Programming Language.
With this file stored as a backup a machine running NixOS could be up and running again in no time after a failure and through the usage of Nix Flakes it is possible to reinstall the system exactly the way it was before.

\section{Bluetooth Low Energy}
\textbf{Author: Jeremy Sztavinovszki}

\subsection{BLE Layers}
\subsubsection{Protocol vs. Profile}
The BLE specification has two important concepts, which it has clearly separated since its inception. These concepts are profiles and protocols. Hereby protocol is used to describe
the basic parts upon which the BLE stack builds and can be thought of the horizontal layers of the stack. Profile refers to vertical slices of the stack, that are used for specific use-cases when developing with BLE. Examples of a profile are.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The Glucose profile, which is used to securely transmit measurement data from e.g. insulin pumps.
	\item The Find Me profile, which allows devices to find one another
\end{itemize}

These use specific parts of the BLE protocol to achieve a specific task.

\subsubsection{Physical Layer PHY}
The Physical Layer (PHY) establishes the foundation for BLE communication by defining radio transmission properties such as modulation schemes, frequency bands, and power levels. It optimizes communication for BLE devices by employing techniques like frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) to mitigate interference and enhance reliability. Advancements in the PHY layer aim to improve data rates, extend range, and enhance spectral efficiency while maintaining low power consumption, which is crucial for the versatility of BLE applications.

\subsubsection{Link Layer (LL)}
The Link Layer(LL)
is responsible for managing essential functions such as connection establishment, maintenance, and data transmission between BLE devices. It handles advertising, scanning, and packet acknowledgment, optimizing power usage during data exchange. The efficient handling of packet formatting, acknowledgment, and error handling ensures a robust and reliable communication link, which is pivotal for BLE's energy-efficient operations.

\subsubsection{Host Controller Interface (HCI)}
The Host Controller Interface (HCI)
serves as the intermediary between the host (application processor) and Bluetooth hardware on the host side. It defines protocols and commands for seamless data exchange, enabling efficient control of Bluetooth functionalities.
The details of the host side are also included.

\paragraph{Host Side}
The HCI on the host side enables communication between the HCI driver and the application processor. It offers a standardised interface that defines the command structures and protocols used by the application to interact with the Bluetooth hardware. This abstraction allows for platform-independent communication and streamlines application development.
The Controller Side should also be considered.

\paragraph{Controller Side}
The HCI on the controller side translates commands from the host into hardware-specific operations for the Bluetooth controller. It facilitates communication between the host and the Bluetooth hardware, ensuring accurate execution of the required actions. This layer is responsible for managing data transfer between the host and controller, optimizing the transmission process


\subsubsection{Logical Link Controll and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)}
The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) efficiently multiplexes higher-layer protocols over BLE connections. It segments and reassembles data packets, optimizing data transmission efficiency while accommodating diverse application requirements. The role of protocol multiplexing and fragmentation is to ensure efficient data exchange while maintaining BLE's low-energy characteristics.

\subsubsection{Attribute Protocol and Generic Attribute Profile}
The Attribute Protocol (ATT) and Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) play critical roles in defining how data is exchanged and accessed between devices. ATT outlines rules for attribute information exchange, while GATT specifies the structure and mechanisms for accessing these attributes. The structured approach provided by data representation and interaction ensures interoperability across various applications and device types.

\subsubsection{Security Manager (SM)}
The Security Manager (SM) operates within the BLE protocol stack and is responsible for establishing secure connections and managing security-related aspects between BLE devices. It manages processes such as pairing, encryption, and authentication to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over BLE connections. This is critical for safeguarding sensitive information.

\subsubsection{General Access Profile}
The Generic Access Profile (GAP) is a fundamental layer in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that is responsible for device discovery, connection setup, and addressing within the network. It defines device roles such as Peripheral and Central, managing how devices interact. Peripherals broadcast their presence, allowing Centrals to discover and connect. GAP also handles device addressing, ensuring unique identification, and manages visibility, pairing, and power modes. GAP promotes interoperability between devices by standardizing essential functions. This ensures smooth communication across diverse BLE devices, regardless of their manufacturers or applications. The layer's importance lies in its ability to provide stability and reliability in BLE networks.

\subsection{Network Topologies}
Using the above protocols and layers, there is a wide range of network topologies that designers can choose from, depending on their objectives.
Some of the following topologies excel at saving power, while others are great for scalability and redundancy.

\subsubsection{Star Topology}
In a star topology, a central device (the 'Central') communicates with multiple peripheral devices. This configuration is similar to a hub-and-spoke model, where the central device manages and controls communication with the peripherals. For example, in a smart home scenario, a smartphone (acting as the central) connects to various peripherals such as smart locks, lights or sensors. The central device collects data from these peripherals and can also coordinate their functions. This architecture is simple and provides centralised control, but it relies heavily on the availability and range limitations of the central device.

\subsubsection{Mesh Topology}
BLE mesh networks allow devices to communicate with each other, forming a decentralised network without a central control point. Each device, or 'node', can communicate with nearby nodes, extending the coverage and redundancy of the network. For example, in a smart lighting system, each bulb can communicate with neighbouring bulbs to relay commands or data, ensuring robustness even if a node fails. Mesh networks are scalable, resilient and suitable for applications that require extensive coverage, such as smart buildings or large-scale sensor networks.

\subsubsection{Hub and Spoke Topology}
This architecture involves a central 'hub' device that communicates with multiple 'spoke' devices, each of which communicates only with the central hub. Think of a smart home setup where a central controller (e.g. a smart hub or gateway) manages and interacts with various sensors, smart appliances or actuators placed throughout the home. Each peripheral device communicates only with the central hub, streamlining communication and enabling centralised management.

\subsubsection{Cluster Tree Topology}
The cluster tree topology forms a hierarchical structure that organises devices into clusters, each cluster having a central node. These central nodes can communicate with other central nodes or higher level devices, creating a structured network. In industrial applications, devices within a particular area or zone can communicate with a local coordinator, which then communicates with higher level coordinators or a central system. This hierarchy enables efficient communication in large deployments, providing local and global control.

\subsubsection{Hybrid Architectures}
BLE applications often use hybrid architectures that combine multiple topologies to meet different needs. For example, a smart building might use a mesh network for inter-floor sensor communication, a star network for room-level control (with each room having a central controller), and a hub-and-spoke network for centralised management and integration of various systems within the building.

\section{Libraries}

\subsection{Catch2}
\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}

Catch2\footcite{catch2_git} is a unit testing framework specifically designed for C++. It seamlessly integrates with C++ code and offers a testing environment 
that aligns closely with the overall structure of C++ code. Its ability to harmonize with the natural syntax of functions and boolean expressions is noteworthy. 
Catch2 not only facilitates unit testing but also incorporates micro-benchmarking capabilities, enabling developers to analyze performance in detail.\\

In the context of our project, Catch2 is an ideal choice for shaping the C++ frontend. Its integration into the development process ensures that unit tests 
become an integral part of the codebase, fostering a culture of code reliability and maintainability. In addition, the integration of micro-benchmarking in Catch2 
is consistent with our project's objectives, enabling thorough performance evaluations. This feature is essential in promoting optimizations, as benchmarks provide 
valuable metrics for measuring the speed and efficiency of implemented methods.\\

By using Catch2, our project benefits from a versatile testing framework that not only validates the functionality of the C++ frontend but also enables developers 
to make informed decisions about enhancements and optimizations. Catch2's seamless integration and benchmarking capabilities make it a valuable asset in ensuring 
the robustness, performance, and efficiency of the implemented methods within the project.

\subsubsection{Unit Tests}

Unit Tests in Catch2 are defined very similarly as normal functions in C++. This example, pulled from the Github repository of Catch2, shows the simplicity of
this framework and its integration into projects.

\begin{verbatim}
    #include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>

    #include <cstdint>
    
    uint32_t factorial( uint32_t number ) {
        return number <= 1 ? number : factorial(number-1) * number;
    }
    
    TEST_CASE( "Factorials are computed", "[factorial]" ) {
        REQUIRE( factorial( 1) == 1 );
        REQUIRE( factorial( 2) == 2 );
        REQUIRE( factorial( 3) == 6 );
        REQUIRE( factorial(10) == 3'628'800 );
    }
\end{verbatim}

First the relevant Catch2 headers are included and then a function with a return value is defined. In this case it is the function factorial. 
This function will be executed by Catch2 during the testing process. Then a test case is a macro defined as:

\begin{verbatim}
TEST_CASE(string testname, string tags) {...test...}
\end{verbatim}

The argument \textit{testname} is a arbitrary name given to the unit test, which is then later during the running of the test printed alongside the results of the macro.
Tags can be given to the test by inputting one or multiple tags into the \textit{tags} field and change the behavior of the macro accordingly. In the case of the example above
the only given tag is the name of the function to be tested. After this the \textit{TEST\_CASE} macro has a curly brackets-enclosed body in which the logic of the test can 
be defined.\\
This requires the use of other specific macros included in the Catch2 framework. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
REQUIRE( function(value) == expected_value );
CHECK( function(value) == expected_value );
\end{verbatim}

The two macros described above, REQUIRE and CHECK, operate in a similar way. They both execute the given \textit{function} with the provided \textit{value} or \textit{values}
and then assert if the returned data equals true or false according to the provided boolean operator. If it does then it was successful and the rest of the \textit{TEST\_CASE} is executed. The difference 
between REQUIRE and CHECK is however that if a REQUIRE macro fails it throws an exception and the unit test is stopped from executing the remainder of code inside it.

\subsubsection{Micro-benchmarks}
The benchmarking macros in Catch2 are defined similarly to how unit tests are. Benchmarking in itself is a useful practice, that provides a way to measure the performance
and speed of a particular function.

\begin{verbatim}
#include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>
#include <catch2/benchmark/catch_benchmark.hpp>

#include <cstdint>

uint64_t fibonacci(uint64_t number) {
    return number < 2 ? number : fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2);
}

TEST_CASE("Benchmark Fibonacci", "[!benchmark]") {
    REQUIRE(fibonacci(5) == 5);

    REQUIRE(fibonacci(20) == 6'765);
    BENCHMARK("fibonacci 20") {
        return fibonacci(20);
    };

    REQUIRE(fibonacci(25) == 75'025);
    BENCHMARK("fibonacci 25") {
        return fibonacci(25);
    };
}
\end{verbatim}

In the example above the unit test macros and benchmark macros from Catch2 are first included in order to be used later. The function to be benchmarked is then defined
After that the TEST\_CASE macro is used combined with the [\!benchmark] tag in order to turn this unit test into a benchmark. In the actual body of the test the function
is first tested weather or not it actually works as intended before any benchmarks are done. This is done with the REQUIRE macro, since it throws an exception if the 
assertion fails, preventing the rest of the benchmark from executing unnecessarily. If all the tests before the benchmarks pass then the actual BENCHMARK macros are
executed.

\begin{verbatim}
BENCHMARK(string name) {
    ... benchmark ...
};
\end{verbatim}

As part of the BENCHMARK macro a arbitrary name is given to it, which is then later during the output of the test used as a identifier for the specific benchmark.
Then the actual logic of the benchmark is then defined within curly brackets giving a lot of freedom in how a certain benchmark is executed. Adding a return statement
within the benchmark will ensure that the compiler doesn't mess with the test.\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
After this is run a summary is automatically output within the command line window. This includes multiple data points that pertain to the execution speed of the tested
function:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Samples:} The amount of times the code within the curly brackets of the BENCHMARK macro is repeated in order to build a dataset to calculate the mean execution time.
    \item \textbf{Iterations:} %Need to find out what this is
    \item \textbf{Estimated run time:} The estimated amount of time the code within the benchmark will take to run. Mesured in milliseconds.
    \item \textbf{Mean/low mean/high mean run time:} The mean time it will take for the code to run as well as the low mean and high mean for this in nanoseconds.
    \item \textbf{Standard deviation:} The standard deviation from the mean time in nanoseconds,
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}

Doxygen\footcite{doxygen_main_site} is a versatile C++ framework that automates the generation of documentation for C++ code. It can also be used for other programming languages such as 
PHP, Java, Python, IDL, and Fortran. Doxygen extracts information directly from annotated source code, making the documentation process more efficient and 
accessible for developers.\\

Doxygen is notable for its flexibility in delivering documentation. The generated documentation can be accessed online through an HTML website or offline 
through a LaTeX document, providing options tailored to developers' preferences. Additionally, Doxygen can derive structure overviews even from non-annotated 
sources, facilitating a holistic understanding of the codebase. The project's architecture can be visualized more effectively by displaying entity relations 
through insightful graphs.\\

A quick overview of a Doxygen implementation shows a well-organized framework that streamlines the documentation process. This implementation improves code 
comprehension and promotes a collaborative development environment by providing a centralized repository of project documentation. The image shows how Doxygen's 
integration simplifies and enhances the documentation workflow, contributing to the clarity and accessibility of the project.\\

First a Doxygen config file, also called a \textit{Doxyfile} is generated in a project using the \textit{Doxywizard} and can be edited using this tool afterwards. 
This file is later read and updated during the generation process from \textit{Doxygen}. The layout files and tag files are also generated and used by \textit{Doxygen}
to facilitate the creation of the documentation.\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textit{Sources} are the files with the actual source code, that will be part of the documentation, in them. These files are read alongside any other additional \textit{Custom}
files. For example the headers for source code, footers for the following document or images to be used in it. There are of course many other files that can be included
in order to refine the result further.\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
Finally \textit{Doxygen} uses all this to generate documentation in the specified formats: XML, LaTex, Man, refman or HTML. \\

\subsubsection{Doxygen Configuration}
The first step in creating documentation with Doxygen is a configuration file. This can be automatically generated by the \textit{Doxywizard} with this command:

\begin{verbatim}
    doxygen -g <config-file>
\end{verbatim}

In this example \textit{<config-file>} is a stand-in for the name of the generated configuration file. There are many tags within this config file that change how 
the end result will look and what sources should be used or ignored. For example the INPUT tag specifies the location that \textit{Doxygen} will search for code and
EXCLUDE forbids it to use files contained within the given directories. After editing the file using a text editor or Doxywizard this command can be used to generate 
the documentation.

\begin{verbatim}
    doxygen <config-file>
\end{verbatim}

Doxygen normally requires the source code to be annotated in order to generate documentation, but a rough version can be made by setting the tag EXTRACT\_ALL to YES.
This will extract even the non-annotated classes and functions from the source code.

\subsubsection{Doxygen Annotation}

If the EXTRACT\_ALL tag is not enabled then the classes, functions and members within the source files need to be annotated in order to be picked up by \textit{Doxygen}
and turned into a documented section. There are many ways of signaling to \textit{Doxygen}, that you want it to produce documentation from a source. In general there
are two ways to do this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Documentation within source:} In this way of annotation special comment blocks are inserted before and after parts of the source code. 
                This will cause the text within this special block to be displayed alongside the class, function, or member within the documentation.
    \item \textbf{Documentation outside source:} In this way of annotation the special comment blocks are written within a separate file and then connected 
                to the sources by way of a reference. With this method references to the source file need to be written within this distinct file.
\end{enumerate}

In \textit{Doxygen} special comment blocks are similar to C++ comments, but with extra characters in order to be picked up during generation. There are many different 
ways to define special comment blocks:\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Javadoc and Qt style:} This way a special block can be definied just like a multi line comment in C++ with a special character after the first *.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
    /**
     *   ... text ...
     */
\end{verbatim}
Or:
\begin{verbatim}
    /*!
     *   ... text ...
     */
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}      
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{C++ comment style:} This style is similar to a C++ single line comment with an added / or ! at the begining.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}  
    ///
    ///  ... text ...
    ///
\end{verbatim}
Or:
\begin{verbatim}
    //!
    //!  ... text ...
    //!
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Visible style:} This is a more clearly visible version of the previous two styles.
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
    /************************************
     *   ... text ...
    ************************************/
\end{verbatim}
Or:
\begin{verbatim}
    //////////////////////////////////////
    ///  ... text ...
    //////////////////////////////////////
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\vspace{\baselineskip}

In documentation outside of the source additional commands are required. At the start of the document file a special comment block needs to have the name of the
file to be documented referenced by putting a backslash or an @ symbol before the filename in the first line of the block. After that any number of other 
special comment blocks can be defined with the first line in each of them being used to reference the desired class, function, member, struct, etc. This is done by
first using the equivalent structural commands and then inserting the definition statement of the chosen object. This can be seen in this example:\\

\begin{verbatim}
    /*! \fn int open(const char *pathname,int flags)
        \brief Opens a file descriptor.

        \param pathname The name of the descriptor.
        \param flags Opening flags.
    */
\end{verbatim}

In this case \textit{fn} is the structural command, which tells \textit{Doxygen} what type the object is.\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The other structural commands that can be seen in this example can be used in both documentation inside sources and outside sources. Using the \textit{brief} command 
is used to give a short description to the object and \textit{param} in order to signify and describe the parameters of this function.\\

\subsubsection{Doxygen Parsing}

During the documentation generation process, Doxygen parses special comment blocks and translates them into various output formats to create comprehensive 
documentation. The parser performs several key processes, culminating in the creation of documentation with Doxygen.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] One of these processes is the conversion of Markdown writing within comment blocks into HTML, ensuring compatibility with web-based documentation platforms. This conversion improves the presentation of textual content, making it more accessible and visually appealing.
    \item[] Special commands embedded within the comment blocks are executed, allowing developers to include custom instructions or annotations. This feature empowers developers to tailor the documentation to specific project requirements, fostering flexibility and customization.
    \item[] Blank lines are handled appropriately. Paragraph separators are strategically used instead of blank lines to enhance the readability and organization of the generated documentation. This helps developers to better understand the information presented.
    \item[] Doxygen generates links to other sections of the documentation based on special comment blocks. The interlinking mechanism enables smooth navigation within the documentation, improving the user experience and promoting a cohesive understanding of the codebase.
    \item[] In situations where the output format is LaTeX, Doxygen converts HTML elements within the comment blocks into LaTeX commands. This transition ensures consistency and compatibility when generating LaTeX documents. It allows developers to choose the format that best suits their documentation needs.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Rusqlite}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Rusqlite is an ergonomic wrapper for using SQLite from Rust similar to rust-postgres. It provides an easy-to-use interface to work with SQLite databases. Using the functions provided by rusqlite you can perform all the common database operations, such as creating tables, inserting Data, querying data, and more simply within your code.
We choose this library for SQLite mainly because of three reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Portability:} SQLite databases can be used across different platforms and operating systems. Given the fact that RECT operates on different small Controllers, portability is very important.
	\item \textbf{Configuration:} There is no need for any complex setup or configuration when working with SQLite. We only need a few tables to work with, so having to configure a database on each controller wouldn't be worth the effort.
	\item \textbf{Local:} SQLite doesn't need any separate server or installation. It contains all the features we need in a small an independent package.
\end{enumerate}

In our case we use rusqlite in order to save the config.json file, containing date for the available connections. Accessing the Data from the database is simply much quicker and saver than reading from the file when we need it.

\subsection{Serde}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Serde is a framework for rust, used for \textbf{ser}ializing and \textbf{de}serializing data structures efficiently and generically. You can find a detailed serde overview \href{https://serde.rs/}{here}.

Serde provides functions to deserialize JSON-files in a simple and quick way, this allows us to use the data from the config.json file in our program with just a few lines of code.

With serde we deserialize the data from the JSON-file into a self-made rust structure, which allows us to use the data properly.

\subsection{Tokio}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

Tokio is asynchronous runtime for rust. In rust asynchronous code doesn't run on it's own in order to make it work the programmer has to use a runtime like Tokio. You can find more in depth descripton of Tokio \href{https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial}{here}.

We picked Tokio because it is the most widely used runtime for async rust code. There are also a lot of Tutorials for Tokio and it is fairly simple to use.

Tokio as our asynchronous runtime allows us to execute multi-threaded async code safely.
