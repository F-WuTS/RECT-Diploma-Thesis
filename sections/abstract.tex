\chapter{Abstract}

\vspace{10mm}

One of the most used softwares in robotics is the Robot Operating System \footcite{ros-site} (ROS for short).
It is a collection of tools and packages used for building high performance robotics applications and
simplifies all communication to topics and messages, which can be recorded and replayed from ROS-Bag files.
This allows for developers to focus on the problem at hand and not reinvent the wheel for communication.
ROS also allows for simulation of various components of robots, which are most often called digital twins.
One of the main downsides of ROS is the complexity it brings with it. This complexity also leads to performance
being very limited on lower powered hardware, like for example the KIPR Wombat Controller \footcite{wombat-controller}.

\medskip

This thesis will explore how to implement a similar software to ROS. It will tackle challenges such as, but not limited
to Inter Process Communication \footcite{ipc-begriff}, communication through Bluetooth Low Energy, TCP and UDP, and
implementation of communication libraries in different programming languages.
