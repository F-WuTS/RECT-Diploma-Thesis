\section{RECT Database}
\textbf{Author: Christoph Fellner}

\subsection{Why SQLite?}
RECT uses a small SQLite database for its backend, but bevor we can talk about the database itself we have to answer the question why we use SQLite in the first place. 
There are a lot of different database systems out there, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In order to find the right database for our use case we have to 
look at the different options and compare them. Given the fact that RECT is made for small controllers, we have to look at memory efficient and rather self-contained 
databases. We also want to avoid any complex setup or configuration, so the database should be easy to use and configure. These fators already limit our options, but there 
are still a lot of viable options left. In order to find the right database for our use case we have to look at the different options and compare them. 

\subsubsection{SQLite}
When looking for a memory efficiently database SQLite is one of the first options that comes to mind. SQLite is a small and fast database, and also serverless, 
which means that it doesn't need a separate server process to operate. 

SQLite was originally made for the US Army in the year 2000 by D. Richard Hipp. Since then the database engine has become open-source. It is writen in the programming language
C, because of that it can be used on a lot of different platforms. Compatability between SQLite and Rust is given through the rusqlite library. The database can also be stored
in memory and accessed asynchronusly.

\subsubsection{MySQL}


\subsubsection{Comparison}
After we looked into the three possiblyties mentioned above we created an enviroment to benchmark the different databases.
