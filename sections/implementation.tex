\section{C++ Implementation}
\textbf{Author: Maximilian Dragosits}
The C++ Implementation is one of the two outward facing components of the RECT stack. Alongside the Python Implementation 
it serves as a library in order for developers to be able to create robots, that are able to communicate with each other, much
easier then before. This is accomplished by abstracting most of the complexities of gRPC behind the \textit{Rectcpp} class. 

The class only needs to be initialized with IP-Addresses for the different services that it offers and be given the IP of 
another of its kind and then it should be a simple act of using the predefined methods within the class in order to 
effortlessly communicate with other robots or devices running this or the Python frontend implementation.
