\section{CommLib}
\textbf{Author: Jeremy Sztavinovszki} 
The Communication Library, or CommLib for short is the part of the RECT stack, that handles all of the communication between the bots over traditional protocols, like TCP, UDP and BLE.
This requires it to be especially performant. In order to avoid premature optimization however, the first part of this section on the implementation of the CommLib will only cover the first versions
of the code written to get the Library to work. After the first implementation there will be benchmarks and some profiling, in order to get a grasp on which aspects of the library need to be
optimized. The second section will then cover how these results were incorperated into designing a more polished version of the CommLib.
